		<h1>Unit 2 HW</h1>
			<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
				<p>I was most inspired by the websites <a href="http://www.studiobrusco.com">studiobrusco.com</a> and <a href="http://www.mainstudio.com">mainstudio.com</a> </p>
			<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
				<p>Studio Brusco uses a grid to optimize space and achieve balance. Size plays a huge part in labeling and headlines, which speaks to balance as well. I suppose it's hard to put into words, but the website just looks good. It's balanced and centered. The negative space doesn't feel empty and the positive space isn't overwhelming. The flow is led by the sizing and spacing of the different elements. Main Studio also "just looks good." I suppose what I like about it is the playful interaction between the positive and negative space. The flow is a a little bit more difficult as I want to click to access more info about projects whereas you go right. I honestly have no clue what the website is about, but it is just so beautiful and elegant.</p>
			<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
				<p>Both websites are veritcal. Both websites are minimal in their asthetic. Both websites highlight their companies specialities in their design. Studio Brusco utilizes video to capture the viewer's interester where Main Studio capitlizes on static images, illustration and geometric forms. I feel like Studio Brusco's site is more accessbile, but both definitely play to their target audience.</p>
			<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
			<ul> 
				<li><Strong>Main Page</Strong></li>
					<img src="main.png">
						<p>Using a grid. I made a website for a party planning site. The three images would include a picture under an opaque heading leading to 3 different pages. The co. logo and a paragraph of text are on the right. A heading bar provides alternative navigation options.</p>
				<li><Strong>Navigational Page 1</Strong></li>
					<img src="navi1.png">
						<p>This page would showcase the co.'s work. Minimal design to emphasize photo samples of work.</p>
				<li><Strong>Navigational Page 2</Strong></li>
					<img src="navi2.png">
						<p>Again using a grid to vertically display all the elements of a project to give clients an idea of possibilities. Scroll thru to see sample menu, photos of venue, flowers, catering, happy people, lists, etc.</p>
				<li><Strong>Navigational Page 3</Strong></li>
					<img src="navi3.png">
						<p>This page would just be a simple blurb as to the mission of the company, their values, promise to the customer, as well as ways to get in touch (e-mail, maybe reviews/references).</p>
				<li><Strong>About Page</Strong></li>
				 	<img src="about.png">
						<p>Again with a grid. Blurbs about co. owners, links out to other associated pages.</p>
